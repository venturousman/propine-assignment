## Question 1 - Programming

_We're looking at your programming ability. It must not only work, it should be maintainable._

Let us assume you are a crypto investor. You have made transactions over a period of time which is logged in a CSV file at the [data directory](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Propine/2b-boilerplate/master/data/transactions.csv). Write a command line program that returns the latest portfolio value per token in USD

The program should be ran like this

```
npm install
npm run start
```

On running, it should return the latest portfolio value per token in USD

The CSV file has the following columns

- timestamp: Integer number of seconds since the Epoch
- transaction_type: Either a DEPOSIT or a WITHDRAWAL
- token: The token symbol
- amount: The amount transacted

Portfolio means the balance of the token where you need to add deposits and subtract withdrawals. You may obtain the exchange rates from [cryptocompare](https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/documentation) where the API is free. You should write it in Node.js as our main stack is in Javascript/Typescript and we need to assess your proficiency.

## Submission

Please take no more than 2 hours to finish. We do not track time, hence you can start and end at your own time. Your answers should comprise of the following

- Source code that you used for deriving the results
- README that explains various design decisions that you took.

Commit your answers in a private Github repository(it's free), please do not fork as other candidates will see your answers. Add Zan(liangzan), Kyle(kyled7), Thanh(thanhnpp), Viswanath(viswanathkgp12) as collaborators then inform us that it is done at zan@propine.com, kyle.dinh@propine.com, thanh.nguyen@propine.com, viswanath.kapavarapu@propine.com.

## SOLUTION

Steps I did in one hour and a half. (9:30 PM to 11 PM)

- Read transaction data from the csv file.
- Order transactions by timestamp ascending.
- Use a dictionary data structure to keep the amount of per token (based on adding deposits and substracting withrawals respectively)
- Call the cryptocompare api to exchange rates in USD.
